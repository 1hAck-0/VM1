# VM1 - External Pattern Scanner
VM1 is a unique external pattern/AOB/signature scanner for Windows by 1hAck. It works for both 32-bit and 64-bit processes. This application was originally made for Game Hacking but you can use it for whatever you like.

## Main Features
- Fast Pattern Scanner
- Multi Pattern Scan (up to 150 at a time)
- Choose Scan Region: a Process, a Module or the whole Virtual Memory
- Supports Text and Code Format
- Generate C++ header files
- JSON based Configuration System
- Filter Scan Results
- Get Scan Result Offset/Module/Process

At First VM1 might seem like a regular pattern scanner, just like the one in Cheat Engine, right? No. Where VM1 really shines is its C++ header file generator feature and config feature. You can save a scan configuration and use it for later after the game gets updated/patched to get offsets and others in seconds.
